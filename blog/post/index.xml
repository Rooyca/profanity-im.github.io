      <title>Profanity and OpenPGP for XMPP (OX)</title>
      <link>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/openpgp-for-xmpp-ox/</link>

      <guid>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/openpgp-for-xmpp-ox/</guid>
      <description>We have been to implement OX in profanity. OX is XEP-0374: OpenPGP for XMPP Instant Messaging which may replace XEP-0027: Current Jabber OpenPGP Usage.
It is part of Profanity since version 0.10 but got some fixes since then.
Feel free to try and test the implementation. Let us know, if you have some issues and support the development via testing and reporting bugs.
How does it works? There are some parts which will be done directly with GnuPG.</description>

      <title>Profanity on Pinephone</title>
      <link>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/profanity-on-pinephone/</link>

      <description>Hi all,
So far, in my pinephone I used mainly GUI applications, because I was using a touch screen. Terminal applications are not user-friendly when it comes to one-handed operation.
I tested different distributions on my pinephone (mobian, manjaro, archarm), but usually most based on Phosh. In my opinion it is currently the best mobile graphics environment and stable as well.
In Phosh I tested few xmpp clients:
the default application installed with Phosh is chatty, a combine that supports sms / mms / xmpp (OMEMO) Dino from repo: handy Gajim I know there are KDE plasma applications as well, but during my testing, plasma was unusable and I even gave up installing it.</description>

      <guid>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/attention-attention/</guid>
      <description>Hello folks,
we have implemented an attention flag in profanity.
The attention flag can be used to mark chats and groupchats where you would like to pay particular attention.
This is only available on master, but will be in the next release (0.11.0).
How it works Open the chat or groupchat window and press shortcut ALT+F. Profanity will display a line to inform you when the attention flag has been activated and deactivated.</description>

      <title>Contributing a Patch via GitHub</title>

      <description>Several people mentioned in our MUC that they have problems contributing code to the Profanity repo on GitHub because &amp;ldquo;forking all the time is cumbersome&amp;rdquo;.
Let me show you an example workflow. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s cumbersome at all. I assume you have an account on GitHub and are logged in. First thing we do is fork the repo. So go to https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity and click on &amp;ldquo;Fork&amp;rdquo;. Now you should be at your fork, in my case this is: https://github.</description>

      <title>XML console in Profanity</title>
      <link>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/xml-console-in-profanity/</link>

      <guid>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/xml-console-in-profanity/</guid>
      <description>Profanity is an XMPP client that allows you to chat with friends. But one feature makes it more than just a client. The name is XML console.
It has been implemented for a long time now, but hasn&amp;rsquo;t found wide spread within Profanity community. I still believe that the XML console is unpopular because users haven&amp;rsquo;t chance to find it and to try it out. And Profanity community has a number of experts who use XMPP in their projects.</description>

      <title>How to run profanity instances within tmux</title>
      <link>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/how-to-run-profanity-instances-within-tmux/</link>

      <guid>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/how-to-run-profanity-instances-within-tmux/</guid>
      <description>If you have more than one XMPP account, you may run one profanity process per account. For example profanity -a AccountName.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to start a tmux session with one window for each profanity instance.
Create a tmux configuration file, e.g. in ~/.config/tmux.
mkdir ~/.config/tmux touch ~/.config/tmux/profanity.conf Within the configuration file, you create a tmux session named Profanity. Followed by one window per XMPP Account. Each window will run a profanity followed by -a accountname.</description>

      <description>From 10th to 14th February 2020 we had Hackweek 19 at SUSE. Part of that time I used to finally implement the long (since 2016!) sought after Last Message Correction feature, aka XEP-0308.
See my Hackweek project and the corresponding pull request.
Usage To enable incoming and outgoing corrections users need to enable it with /correction on, see /help correction for more details.
Now we write a message to a friend /msg Martin Hey therr!</description>

      <title>How to get a backtrace</title>
      <link>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/how-to-get-a-backtrace/</link>

      <guid>https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/how-to-get-a-backtrace/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re running profanity master it may occur that profanity crashes
with SIGSEGV or SIGABRT when new features are added. If this happens it
is helpful to provide a backtrace for the developers to find and fix the
bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will explain one possibility how to get a backtrace of profanity
(or any other TUI application)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
